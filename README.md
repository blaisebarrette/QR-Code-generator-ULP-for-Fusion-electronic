## System Requirements

Choose the appropriate version for your operating system:
- [qrcode_generator_mac.zip](https://github.com/blaisebarrette/QR-Code-generator-ULP-for-Fusion-electronic/releases/download/V1.0.3/qr_code_generator_mac.zip) for MacOS systems
- [qrcode_generator_win.zip](https://github.com/blaisebarrette/QR-Code-generator-ULP-for-Fusion-electronic/releases/download/V1.0.3/qr_code_generator_mac.zip) for Windows systems

## Installation

![Place ULP on your hard drive](Media/Install_ULP.png)

- Open Fusion 360
- Click on your profile icon in the top right corner
- Click on `Preferences`
- In the left panel, expand `Electronics` and click on `Directory`
- Find `Directory for ULPs` and click on the three dots
- Choose the folder where you want Fusion Electronics to find the ULPs
  - I suggest creating a folder named `ULP` in your `Documents/Autodesk` directory
- Alternatively, you can uncheck `Use Library.io for ULP by default`
- Choose the appropriate version for your operating system:
  - [qrcode_generator_mac.zip](https://github.com/blaisebarrette/QR-Code-generator-ULP-for-Fusion-electronic/releases/download/V1.0.3/qr_code_generator_mac.zip) for MacOS systems
  - [qrcode_generator_win.zip](https://github.com/blaisebarrette/QR-Code-generator-ULP-for-Fusion-electronic/releases/download/V1.0.3/qr_code_generator_mac.zip) for Windows systems
- Place the ULP file in the `ULP` folder you just created

That's it! The ULP is now available from Fusion Electronics!

## Usage

1. Open your PCB design or schematic in Eagle/Fusion360 Electronics.
2. Click the `Run ULP` icon on the 2D PCB or schematic `AUTOMATE` toolbar.
3. In the ULP browser, select `qrcode_generator_mac` for MacOS or `qrcode_generator_win` for Windows.
4. Double-click the selected ULP to execute it.
5. Alternatively, type `run` in the command line and press Enter to open the ULP browser.
6. You can also type `RUN qrcode_generator_mac` for MacOS or `RUN qrcode_generator_win` for Windows in the command line and press Enter.
7. In the dialog box:
   - Input the URL for the QR code.
   - Specify the size in mils (1000 mils = 1 inch).
   - Choose the destination layer.

The QR code will be placed automatically in the upper-left quadrant of the origin.

Important Note on URL Length:
Generating a QR code from a long URL increases its complexity. Highly complex QR codes may become difficult to scan if printed too small. If your PCB design has limited space for the QR code, consider using a service like <a href="http://bitly.com" target="_blank">bitly.com</a> to shorten the URL before generating the QR code. This reduces the codeâ€™s complexity, making it easier to scan when printed.

Example:

Here is a comparison between QR codes of different sizes, generated from long (left) and short (right) URLs:

## Technical Notes

- QR code is generated via a secure cloud service
- Minimum size: 250 mils (0.25 inch / 6.25 mm)
- Maximum size: 5000 mils (5 inch / 127 mm)
- Version checking ensures compatibility
- Automatic mirroring for bottom layers
- Language selection based on system settings

## Error Handling

The ULP includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- API availability
- Version compatibility
- Invalid responses
- File operations
